# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Project Overview

This repository contains a series of labs for the "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" course. Each lab focuses on different aspects and techniques of AI, implemented and demonstrated through various programming tasks.

## Lab Descriptions

### Lab 1: Search Methods

- **Files**:
  - `searchMethods.py`: Contains the implementation of various search algorithms.
  - `Raport laboratorium 1.pdf`: Detailed report of the lab.
  - `README.md`: Description and instructions for Lab 1.

This lab introduces basic search algorithms, including breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS). The implementation demonstrates how these algorithms can be applied to solve search problems efficiently.

### Lab 2: Algorithm Optimization

- **Files**:
  - `algorithm.py`: Contains the implementation of optimization algorithms.
  - `generateMatrix.py`: Script to generate matrices for testing.
  - `Raport laboratorium 2.pdf`: Detailed report of the lab.
  - `README.md`: Description and instructions for Lab 2.

This lab focuses on optimization algorithms. Students learn about and implement algorithms for optimizing solutions to problems, with practical applications demonstrated through matrix operations.

### Lab 3: Game Playing Agents

- **Files**:
  - `Board.py`: Defines the game board.
  - `Game.py`: Manages game logic.
  - `Player.py`: Defines player strategies.
  - `main.py`: Main script to run the game.
  - `Raport laboratorium 3.pdf`: Detailed report of the lab.
  - `README.md`: Description and instructions for Lab 3.

In this lab, students implement game-playing agents. The focus is on creating intelligent agents capable of playing and competing in games, using strategies and decision-making processes.

### Lab 4: Decision Trees and Histograms

- **Files**:
  - `Tree.py`: Implementation of decision trees.
  - `histogram.py`: Script to generate histograms.
  - `main.py`: Main script to demonstrate the implementations.
  - `Raport laboratorium 4.pdf`: Detailed report of the lab.
  - `README.md`: Description and instructions for Lab 4.

This lab covers decision trees and their application in making decisions based on data. Additionally, histograms are used to visualize data distributions, providing insights into the underlying data.
